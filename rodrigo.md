The structure of the dispersion relation is one of the central aspects to the study of periodic Schrödinger operators. 

Besides the intrinsic interest from the viewpoint of several complex variables and algebraic geometry, the dispersion relation also carries relevant information for the spectral theory of periodic media. In particular, for the structure of spectral boundaries, isospectrality, and existence of eigenvalues for locally perturbed operators. 

I will discuss some of these connections as well as recent irreducibility theorems for the Bloch and Fermi varieties,
focusing on two joint works with Jake Fillman and Wencai Liu:
- Algebraic Properties of the Fermi Variety for Periodic Graph Operators, [2305.06471](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06471)
- Irreducibility of the Bloch Variety for Finite-Range Schrödinger Operators, [2107.06447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06447)

These recent papers cover a wide class of lattice geometries in arbitrary dimension and verify the discrete version of certain conjectures of Kuchment for various discrete models.


#### A comment from Sergey: 

Rodrigo will introduce us to an area at the intersection of algebraic geometry, spectral theory, and mathematical physics. The very same Laurent polynomials appear in the study of [Fermi varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_surface) of periodic Schrödinger operators, in [mirror symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory)) for [Fano varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_variety) and [K3 surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K3_surface), in Apery's approximation for [zeta(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ap%C3%A9ry's_constant), in two-loops diagrams for [Bhabha scattering](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3951114), and many other places.
