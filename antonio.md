## [random matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix), graphs and a combinatorial proof of [Wigner's Semi-Circle Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_semicircle_distribution)

In this seminar, we present a combinatorial proof of
         [Wigner's Semi-Circle Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_semicircle_distribution),
a fundamental result in [random matrix theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix).
It describes the limiting behavior of the eigenvalue distribution of large Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) matrices. While the original proof of the Semi-Circle Law relies on advanced techniques from analysis, our approach provides an alternative perspective through combinatorial methods.
