# üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Friday seminar üëã

# April 14, **Filipe Bellio da N√≥brega**:   pencils of conics

(the talk will start after a conference in UFF - last talk at the conference ends at 13:10,
so some participants will arrive back to PUC around 14:00 or a bit later)

A __conic__ is an algebraic curve given by the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables, as $ax^2+2hxy+by^2+2fxz+2gyz+cz^2$. Such an expression is given by six coefficients, but multiples of a given equation correspond to the same curve. Therefore, the moduli space of __real conics__ and of __complex conics__ are $\mathbf{RP}^5$ and $\mathbf{CP}^5$ respectively.

A __real (complex) pencil of conics__ is a one-parameter family of conics given by a __real (complex) line__ in the suitable moduli space. Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct conics, the pencil that contains them can be algebraically given by $\alpha u + \beta v$, where $[\alpha \colon \beta] \in \mathbf{RP}^1$ (or $\mathbf{CP}^1$). In this talk we will describe and classify all orbits of pencils of conics under the action of the projective group $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{R})$ ( and $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{C})$ ).

## where: 
  - **DMAT PUC-Rio**, room **L856** in Leme building (left from main entrance)
  - take an elevator to 8th floor near the "Bar Nossa Senhora do Carmo" (one with nuns) in front of "Livraria Carga Nobre" bookshop
 
## when:
  - Fridays (sexta-feira) from **14:00 to 16:00** 
  - usually we lunch around 12:50-üçø-13:50, just before the talk

## April 14: Filipe Bellio da N√≥brega: Pencils of Conics
A __conic__ is an algebraic curve given by the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables, as $ax^2+2hxy+by^2+2fxz+2gyz+cz^2$. Such an expression is given by six coefficients, but multiples of a given equation correspond to the same curve. Therefore, the moduli space of __real conics__ and of __complex conics__ are $\mathbf{RP}^5$ and $\mathbf{CP}^5$ respectively.

A __real (complex) pencil of conics__ is a one-parameter family of conics given by a __real (complex) line__ in the suitable moduli space. Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct conics, the pencil that contains them can be algebraically given by $\alpha u + \beta v$, where $[\alpha \colon \beta] \in \mathbf{RP}^1$ (or $\mathbf{CP}^1$). In this talk we will describe and classify all orbits of pencils of conics under the action of the projective group $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{R})$ ( and $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{C})$ ).

## March 31: [**Jacques Pienaar**](https://www.jaypienaar.com): [QBism](http://www.physics.umb.edu/Research/QBism/), an introduction for mathematicians

## March 24: **Bruno Suassuna**: Formal Perturbation Theory for Stochastic Paths
- Short abstract for mathematicians:

We discuss methods of perturbative QFT applied to certain stochastic differential equations (SDE), perturbations of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. No knowledge of SDE or QFT is assumed.

Perturbative QFT amounts to some sort of generating function for formal power series expansions, and these methods have found many applications in pure and applied mathematics. This is the main motivation for this talk. The lack of mathematical proofs often comes together with the magical formulas derived from these methods, and this will also be examplified in this talk. 

The application we discuss was the subject of joint work with Bruno Melo (ETH Zurich) and Thiago Guerreiro (PUC-RIO), published (PhysRevA) in January 2021.

- Fine-print for physicists:

The motivation comes from experiments with optical tweezers, which roughly are laser beams able to trap certain particles around a point of mechanical equilibrium. The particle does not sit in the mechanical equilibrium, but jiggles stochastically around it; this stochasticity is known as Brownian motion and is the reason one uses SDE instead of ODE in the mathematical models. Often the working assumption is that the optical forces are a linear function of the displacement from mechanical equilibrium, which as we know is simply a first order Taylor approximation. We provided a way to deal with optical forces modelled by a linear function perturbed by small non-linearities, so potentially this method would be useful for sufficiently precise experiments. The validity of our method was probed by some numerical experiments, and for mysterious reasons it seems to work.
