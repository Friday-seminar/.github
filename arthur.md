In 1981, Andr√© Joyal started the development of an interesting theory of species of structures.
In his theory, combinatorial species (e.g. graphs, permutations) can be seen
as endofunctors of the category of finite sets and bijections.
This allows the study of operations, like addition and multiplication, of species,
which became a key technique for enumeration.

In this talk, we will present a brief introduction to this technique,
and some interesting examples of its usage in enumerative combinatorics.
