Torelli's theorem for compact Riemann surfaces of genus g ≥ 1 states that if J is the Jacobian variety of a compact Riemann surface X equipped with its canonical polarization, then the canonical image of X in J is uniquely determined by J, up to a transformation of the form x → ±x ± a.

In simpler terms, given a compact Riemann surface X and its corresponding Jacobian variety J with the canonical polarization, the image of X inside J, defined by the canonical map, is uniquely determined by the Jacobian variety J. Any two compact Riemann surfaces with the same Jacobian variety and canonical polarization have isomorphic canonical images, up to a translation by a point (x → x + a) and inversion of the coordinate (x → -x).
