## [Mirror symmetry for Jacobians of hyper-elliptic curves](https://sites.google.com/view/art-kalm/research#h.qnpzcvbpci3u)

### August 11 -- online/hybrid, MIT --> DMAT PUC-Rio room 856 (TBC)

In this talk I will present a [mirror symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory))
constructions for [Jacobians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_variety) of
[hyperelliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperelliptic_curve). In particular,
using the abelian/non-abelian correspondence by Ciocan-Fontanine--Kim--Sabbah
[arXiv:math/0610265](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610265), we will calculate its J-function which usually encodes
the [Gromov-Witten invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gromovâ€“Witten_invariant) of a variety,
but turns out to be nontrivial in this case. Furthermore we will construct a certain family of complex tori
that could be considered as the mirror family by some numerical evidences.
Based on work ["Mirror symmetry for Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves](https://github.com/art-kalm/math/blob/master/ms_jacobians.pdf).
