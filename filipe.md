A __conic__ is an algebraic curve given by the zero set of a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables, as $ax^2+2hxy+by^2+2fxz+2gyz+cz^2$. Such an expression is given by six coefficients, but multiples of a given equation correspond to the same curve. Therefore, the moduli space of __real conics__ and of __complex conics__ are $\mathbf{RP}^5$ and $\mathbf{CP}^5$ respectively.

A __real (complex) pencil of conics__ is a one-parameter family of conics given by a __real (complex) line__ in the suitable moduli space. Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct conics, the pencil that contains them can be algebraically given by $\alpha u + \beta v$, where $[\alpha \colon \beta] \in \mathbf{RP}^1$ (or $\mathbf{CP}^1$). In this talk we will describe and classify all orbits of pencils of conics under the action of the projective group $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{R})$ ( and $\mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbf{C})$ ).
