## [Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares), their relation to [finite projective planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane#Finite_projective_planes), and all that
### June 2, **9:00-11:00**, DMAT PUC-Rio, room L856 (ed. Leme)

I will introduce the concept of a finite projective plane (FPP), their basic structure, and show the existence of some of them. Beside that, I will talk about Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS), a "categorical" way to visualize it and how they interact with FPP. If possible I will talk about more complex FPP existence theorems.
